            Welcome to glidepay. By using the app you agree to these terms. Read
            them, they are short.
          </p>

          <h2>What glidepay is</h2>
          <p>
            glidepay is a mobile-first stablecoin wallet built on Arc,
            Circle&apos;s payments blockchain. We let you send, receive, swap,
            and bridge stablecoins (USDC, EURC, cirBTC) using a smart account
            managed by Circle. We are not a bank, broker-dealer, or money
            transmitter. We do not take custody of your funds. Circle does.
          </p>

          <h2>Testnet status</h2>
          <p>
            glidepay currently operates on <strong>Arc testnet</strong>. Tokens
            on testnet have <strong>no monetary value</strong>. Do not treat
            anything you see in the app as real money. We make no guarantees
            about availability, performance, or data retention during the
            testnet phase.
          </p>

          <h2>Your responsibilities</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keep your email and authentication credentials secure. Anyone
              with access to your email can take over your glidepay account.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only send to addresses and people you trust. Crypto transactions
              are irreversible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not use glidepay for anything illegal, fraudulent, or harmful.
              This includes money laundering, tax evasion, sanctions evasion,
              financing of terrorism, and impersonation.
            </li>
            <li>You are responsible for any taxes owed on your activity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our responsibilities</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We make a good-faith effort to keep the service up and secure,
              but we do not promise uninterrupted operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not guarantee that any feature will continue to exist.
              Testnet features may change or disappear.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will give reasonable notice before deleting accounts or data
              we have stored, except where required by law or to address abuse.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
          <p>
            You may not (a) use the app in any jurisdiction where doing so is
            unlawful; (b) attempt to interfere with, decompile, or
            reverse-engineer the app; (c) abuse our service infrastructure
            (denial of service, scraping, mass spam); (d) misrepresent yourself
            as another user or entity.
          </p>

          <h2>Crypto risk</h2>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and on-chain transactions involve
            risk. Smart contracts can have bugs. Blockchains can have outages.
            Stablecoins can de-peg. You accept these risks when using glidepay.
            On mainnet (when we get there) this will matter much more than on
            testnet.
          </p>

          <h2>No warranty, limited liability</h2>
          <p>
            The service is provided &quot;as is&quot; without warranty of any
            kind, express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
            our total liability for any claim arising from your use of glidepay
            is limited to USD $100 or the amount you have paid us in the last
            12 months, whichever is greater. (You have not paid us anything; we
            do not charge for the testnet app. The cap exists for legal
            completeness.)
          </p>

          <h2>Changes</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these terms. Material changes will be announced
            in-app. Continued use after a change means you accept the new
            terms.
          </p>

          <h2>Termination</h2>
          <p>
            You can delete your account at any time from Profile, Delete
            account. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these
            terms.
          </p>

          <h2>Governing law</h2>
          <p>
            These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA.
            Any disputes will be resolved in Delaware courts.
          </p>
